# Biography

I am a 3rd year student at Brock University that found themself feeling stuck within their acidemic career. After 2 years in the social sciences, I came to the conclusion that it was not the life for me. I wanted to create, contribute, work with people. I've always had a passion for the digital world, whether it be audio, visual, games... you name it. As a digital humanities student I beleive it is important for us as field of study to express our voices and be heard as not a feild based purley on the grounds of crafting and creating for the digital arts, but as a program that expresses a need for both theory and creation. It is as important to have the how as well as the why. Down below you will find two of my works as a digital humanities student. One an essay on Bergson's idea of time in a digital format, and the other a PechaKucha on Zune. The PechaKuca takes the idea of Zune and puts it into a light as if it was more sucessful than apple. This is a fun way of thinking, within the slides you can find in the notes that I disscuss the history of Zune, how and why it lost to apple, and then recreate the product so that it was more sucessful. The linked version of the slide show has been a revised edition with 5 extra slides that explore the world of Zune more in depth with other concepts that apple has achived, as well as some Microsoft products that currently exist. 

## Collabrative Project

Here you will find my work done in a collaborative project for a free open source software known as Linked Jazz. The slide show explains and explores Linked Jazz as an open source data collection that specializes in finding the relationships between Jazz musicians. By going through archived interviews and finding names within them and how they are mentioned the website also lets you know in which way the musicians were in relation. Relation can be a band member, teacher, or friend. The Website has since shut down but however it was run by volunteers and Jazz enthusiast alike.

For the slide show I helped by finding and cropping images for slides 3 & 8 – 16, adding a more aesthetically pleasing vibe to the slides. In relation to this I also did the research for slides 8 – 14. Slide 8 explains where the data comes from, in which I display a picture containing the names of jazz artists as well as animated another picture to display what happens when you click on an artist displaying the information data. Slide 9 displays a picture of “52nd street”, the public data base where users can analyze interview transcripts and contribute to the project by finding relationships between musicians, in my findings I found that the 52nd Street servers have since been shut down. Slides 10 – 13 explain the research journey as a user by exploring the Network visualization tool. The slides are a step by step breakdown of the tool. Showing how when you select a musician it displays the network of all the musicians they have been in contact with around them. From there you can further investigate their relationships. The final slide I worked on, slide 15, displays all the user problems I had with all the aspects of the tool.
