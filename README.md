# Digital Biography

I am a 3rd year student at Brock University that found themself feeling stuck within their acidemic career. After 2 years in the social sciences, I came to the conclusion that it was not the life for me. I wanted to create, contribute, work with people. I've always had a passion for the digital world, whether it be audio, visual, games... you name it. As a digital humanities student I beleive it is important for us as field of study to express our voices and be heard as not a feild based purley on the grounds of crafting and creating for the digital arts, but as a program that expresses a need for both theory and creation. It is as important to have the how as well as the why. Down below you will find two of my works as a digital humanities student. One an essay on Bergson's idea of time in a digital format, and the other a PechaKucha on Zune. The PechaKuca takes the idea of Zune and puts it into a light as if it was more sucessful than apple. This is a fun way of thinking, within the slides you can find in the notes that I disscuss the history of Zune, how and why it lost to apple, and then recreate the product so that it was more sucessful. The linked version of the slide show has been a revised edition with 5 extra slides that explore the world of Zune more in depth with other concepts that apple has achived, as well as some Microsoft products that currently exist.
