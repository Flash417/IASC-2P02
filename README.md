Welcome to my blog post and page, here you will find basic information about me as well as a blog post about using graphs to display spatial data.

# About Me

I am a 3rd year student at Brock University that found themself feeling stuck within their acidemic career. After 2 years in the social sciences, I came to the conclusion that it was not the life for me. I wanted to create, contribute, work with people.
