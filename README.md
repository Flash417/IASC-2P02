##About Me
**I have no idea what I am doing!**

This is a bio apparently so here we go.
1. I have limited knowledge of HTML
2. I like colourful things and get distacted by them easily 
3. ... sorry there was a purple thing on my screen 

Anyways I'm sure you get the picture, so why am I *here*?

Well thruth be told I'm a musician and a voice actor that wanted to work in the electronic entertainment field, and the best way to do that was to know how the field works.

I know, I know long way around right. 

Well in the meantime of being here I also discovered something. I want to do so much more. 

Animate, and create stories for videogames. 

Long shot but, it's worth a try.
