# The relations of Graphs, Time, and People 

	When Henri Bergson argued that we conceive time in spatial terms, he challenged us all to stop thinking about time perception as linear and constant. Though many may argue against the idea of graphing time based on human perception, we see two cases where this is done to the greatest effect. Both Moretti, and Drucker demonstrate this. Moretti graphs the rise and fall of novels in different parts of the world in his paper Graphs, Maps, Trees and talks about looking outside the box, to think about the causes around the trends. Drucker talks about using graphs to visualize the human perception of time in Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display. Even though we can easily display time perception with digital media such as gifs or videos, graphs are used in effective ways. This post will explore in deeper context Moretti’s use of graphical display and elaborate on Drucker’s use of graphs in relation to a flow state study, Distorted Time Perception during Flow as Revealed by an Attention-Demanding Cognitive Task. We will also be looking at graphical relations between the papers.
  
	In Moretti’s paper “Graphs, Maps, Trees”, Moretti displays the data of sales, publication, genre, types of authors, and location of novels created throughout time. When looking at the graphs at first, we are given a basic representation of the correlation of time regarding whatever the main theme of the graph is. Ie, number of books publicised in one part of the world. The data created by these graphs could not be represented in any other form and still be useful for research and data. Let me elaborate. In Moretti’s graph Authorship of new novels, Britain 18000 – 1829: gender breakdown (percentage) aka. Figure 12, we see a spike in novels written by women between the times of 1810 and 1815. By visually seeing this graph as humanitarians we can ask “what is happening in Britain during this time that would cause that” thanks to the reading Moretti gives us the answer. This was the era of Jane Austen, where women’s romance novels where the top seller, referred to as “The English Novel in The Romantic Era” by Peter Garside. Displaying this data in a gif format or video would leave us confused and with out any visualization to speculate on what is happening in the world. To further elaborate on the use of time in graphs lets look further into this with Drucker, and the flow state.    
  
	Drucker uses graphs to represent time in unconventional ways. Either in swirls, spikes, or balls usually leaving the reader confused. What Drucker is mapping here is the effect of human emotion and the distortion of time perception. Time as a natural standing thing is a constant that can be graphed accordingly, however the time perceived by people is something much different and cannot be graphed using standard methods. In a study done by Soo-hyun & Im Sashank, participants were asked to complete 3 blocks of a trail marking test each with various levels of difficulty (low, medium, high). This study was done to measure time distortion within the participants once they reached a flow state. This study classified the state of flow as time awareness. 
  
If the challenge of a task is high and comparable to a person’s skill level, and if they are consequently in the flow state, then their subjective experience of time will be slower than the objective, elapsed time. By contrast, if a task is too challenging given a person’s skill level or if it is not challenging enough—if he or she is anxious or bored, respectively—then the subjective experience of time will be faster than the objective, elapsed time. Informally speaking this, is the difference between time flying and time crawling. (Hyun & Sashank, 2018)

	Using the description of Flow state in this study in relation to graphical data, Drucker’s graphs are the most effective way to display this data. If we were to compare the difference of time perception between someone in flow state and out of flow sate using a gif or video, we would be left with a subjective message and virtually no chart or mark to base the time off.

  For sake of argument, using the readings we had in class I plugged in the words; graph, time, interpretation, & data. My argument and point were to show the relation between these words, we want to express time on a graphs which are in turn interpretations of data. I found that while “graph” and “time” have a positive correlation, constantly do we see that “interpretation”, “data”, and “time” are mentioned all within the same frequency rate. With this finding we can conclude that despite the argument that time is spatial and should not be represented on graphs, in scholarly studies related to this class the frequency is constant. Not only do we see time being mentioned while graphs are talked about, but time is on a positive correlation in regards to the word graph as well. If we were to eliminate graphs completely and compare time to other types of data, we can see that time would be on the same frequency wavelength as the words data, and interpretation.
