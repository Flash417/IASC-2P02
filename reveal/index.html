					<h2>Zune</h2>
					<p>The forgotten child</p>
					<aside class="notes">As many of you may or may not remember Zune was Microsoft’s first attempt at creating a revolutionary and hip Mp3 player. Given your faces and reactions, I’m sure many of you either never heard of Zune, don’t remember Zune, or had one and hated it. You’re reasons may vary however, what I’m here to talk about is what would have happened if Zune was successful. </aside>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h2>What made Zune</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Before I get into the crazy and slightly scary fantasy of “if Zune took over” we need to go back and jog everyone’s memories. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you, the early 2000’s. More specially, 2004. This was the birth of Zune... kinda, Zune was MSN Music before MSN was closed in 2006 right before the birth of Zune. Both were launched to compete against Apple’s Itunes.  </aside>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<aside class="notes">In 2006 the first generation Zune’s came out manufactured by Toshiba with the help of Microsoft. The Zune marketplace was also added to everyone’s Xbox at the time so that they could also use their game console as a streaming device. All seems well, however the physical Zune models sucked. As you can see this device was huge and over all unaesthetically pleasing to look at. The device however was the most functional out of all of apples competitors.</aside>
	
				</section>


				<section>
				<h2>Where did we go wrong</h2>	
					<aside class="notes">But there is a reason the Ipod took off and Zune did not. At the time of release the first generation Zune was up against the 5th generation classic IPod. That gave apple a 5 generation advantage to fix problems over zune. Let’s go deeper though and look at the tech specs between the first generation zune and the 5th generation ipod.</aside>
				</section>

				<p>Lost causes</p>
					<aside class="notes">As we all know, if you had the biggest storage you were the coolest kid at school. Apples 5 gen came out with 30, 60, and even 80 gb of storage. Zune only had 30. Apple had a 14hr audio battery life where zune only offered 12. Oddly enough these were the only big tech differences I could find.</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<img src="img/Zune Colours.jpg">
					<h2 style="color: red;">Zune Wins</h2>
					<aside class="notes">So where did Zune do better? Well all Zunes offered more colour options than apple. Zune also offered wireless multiplayer gaming. Not to mention both were sold at the same price. So what happened. I mean sure we got the Zune Pad over the apple scroll wheel but does that really matter.</aside>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<img src="img/Zune Display.jpg">
				<p>Lost memories</p>
					<aside class="notes">In my own opinion I believe the downfall of Zune was not being innovative and copy catting apple. For every Ipod that came out until 2009 there was a Zune to follow. Ipod mini and nano? Enter Zune 4, Zune 8, and Zune 6 in that exact order. 6 was 16GB hence the name but we all know Microsoft cant count. </aside>
				</section>


				<section>
					<img src="img/Zune HD.jpg">
					<h2>Zune's were seriously cool</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Remember when the ipod touch was a thing? We got a Zune for that enter the Zune HD offering the same things as apple accept with 11 more hours of battery life, you could shuffle whole albums, finger paint on it, windows messenger, hell you could even play Doom on it! It was the iPod for PC users. But by then it was too late. Apple had won.</aside>
			
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<img src="img/Black Zune.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">On March 15th 2011 Microsoft announced the end of Zune. No more manufacturing. No more new models. But everyone was encouraged to switch to the Windows phone which would be so much better. That’s right. Your precious Windows phone was just Zune HD 2.0!</aside>
				</section>
				

				<section>
				<img src="img/First Zune.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Ultimately the main problem here was not Zunes innovation but Zunes complication. Sure Zune’s offered a whole wack of software, cool features, in some cases better battery power, and of course a wide variety of colours but at the time it was apples simple design choices and user friendly software and interface that gave it the win.</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<img src="img/Zune with box.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Zunes became known as the knock off version of iPod and by time the touch rolled around it didn’t even make any top lists for portable mp3 players, which is shocking because after comparing the two I would have preferred a Zune HD. But let’s take this back and rewrite history. Let’s look at a time line where Zunes took off an apple was the laughing stock at Walmart.     </aside>
				</section>
		
		

				<section>
					<img src="img/B w B.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">In order to do this properly I decided to rewrite apples history and replace it with Microsoft and let Zune be the forerunner of its market base. I mean sure the easy way out would have been to come up here ramble on about Zune Pads, and Zune books, and the next Zune Phone 82. But let’s go deeper, and completely eradicate apple from existence and see what life would be like under zune.</aside>
				</section>


				<section> 
					<img src="img/B&R.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Now when we last stopped off on planet Zune we were stuck with the Zune HD and apple went forward to release the iphone. Well as I said earlier Boom Zune phone! I know I said I wasn’t going to do this, but I lied. Imagine the power of Zune HD but better all in the palm of your hands. Funny enough, mobile gaming would be more possible then it was then, we’d have better custom-built phones, different colour options. And best thing yet, we could upload our illegally downloaded files right to our phones. </aside>
				</section>
				
				<section> 
					<img src="img/Zune3.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Say goodbye to facetime oh no, now we have Skype for all your personal face to face connections. Itunes, wrong. Zune Tunes. Nike + is no longer bugging you to run for your life. And google maps is your number one GPS device. Man life seems great but if only we could make it better… more portable, more accessible. Zune watch! That will fix it!</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section> 
					<img src="img/Zune5.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Furthermore, we could have had Zune TV which sounds catchy. Zune Home for our smart speakers. And the best day yet would have been the announcement of Zune working together with Dr. Dre to release wait for it. Zunes by Dre. </aside>
